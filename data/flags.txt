# This flags file contains flag conditions.
# Names are data.frame column names (without parenthesized units).
# Binary boolean operators are: =, <, <=, >, >=, or, and.
# There should be spaces around operators.
# Note 'and' (like multiplication) has higher precendence than 'or' (addition).
# R language operators are also allowed: &&, ||, == and parentheses.
# For each row in a data.frame, each condition is evaluated for values on that
# row and if TRUE then the condition number is included in the flagged column
# value for that row. Multiple conditions are separated by ';'. For example,
# 1;2
# indicates that row is flagged because conditions 1 and 2 were TRUE.

# 1. Here is a simple condition:
temperature < 5 or temperature > 30

# 2. Here is a multi-value condition:
 humidity < 0 or humidity > 100 or humidity > 30 and temperature > 25

# 3. Here is a timestamp condition:
2022-06-01T12 <= timestamp and timestamp <= 2022-06-01T14
